# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following
# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface
# class:
#-keepclassmembers class fqcn.of.javascript.interface.for.webview {
#   public *;
#}

# Uncomment this to preserve the line number information for
# debugging stack traces.
#-keepattributes SourceFile,LineNumberTable

# If you keep the line number information, uncomment this to
# hide the original source file name.
#-renamesourcefileattribute SourceFile

# WorkManager (the background sync, SyncWorker.kt) and the Room database it
# keeps its work in make these by reflection, with these constructors. R8 in
# AGP 9 no longer keeps a constructor because the class is kept (strict full
# mode), and without them WorkManager fails to start in release builds.
